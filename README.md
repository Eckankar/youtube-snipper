1. **Download any video** from YouTube or other supported platforms
2. **Visually select clips** using an interactive timeline editor

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: One-File Install (No Cloning Needed)

You can run YouTube Snipper by simply downloading the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Eckankar/youtube-snipper/raw/main/docker-compose.yml) file and placing it in a folder on your computer. This works great with platforms like **Dockge**, **Portainer**, or any system that can run Docker Compose.

1. **Download docker-compose.yml**
   - [Get the file here](https://github.com/Eckankar/youtube-snipper/raw/main/docker-compose.yml)
   - Place it in a folder (e.g. `youtube-snipper`)

2. **Create a `.env` file for configuration**
   - Download [`.env.example`](https://github.com/Eckankar/youtube-snipper/raw/main/.env.example) to the same folder and rename it to `.env`
   - Edit `.env` and configure:
     - **User permissions:**
       - **Windows users**: Use `UID=1000` and `GID=1000`
       - **Mac/Linux users**: Run `id -u` and `id -g` to get your IDs, then update `.env`
     - **Projects folder:** Set `PROJECTS_PATH` to where you want to store downloaded videos and projects
       - **Windows example**: `PROJECTS_PATH=C:/Users/YourName/youtube-snipper-data`
       - **Mac/Linux example**: `PROJECTS_PATH=/home/yourname/youtube-snipper-data`
       - If not set, defaults to `./projects` (a subfolder next to docker-compose.yml)

3. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   Or use your Docker Compose GUI (Dockge, Portainer, etc.) to start the stack.

4. **Open the app**
   - Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

5. **Stop the app**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Install (Clone the Repo)

If you want to modify the code or run in development mode:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eckankar/youtube-snipper.git
   cd youtube-snipper
   ```

2. **Configure user permissions and projects folder**
   ```bash
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   copy .env.example .env

   # On Mac/Linux:
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Edit `.env`:
     - **User permissions:** Set `UID` and `GID` as above for your OS
     - **Projects folder:** Set `PROJECTS_PATH` to your desired location
       - If not set, defaults to `./projects` (a subfolder in the repository)
       - Consider using a location outside the repo if you want to persist data across repo updates

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Open the app**
   - Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. **Stop the app**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Video won't download:**
- Check if the URL is from a supported site (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
- Some videos may be region-locked or age-restricted

**Permission errors on Linux/Mac:**
- Make sure your `UID` and `GID` in `.env` match your user
- Run `id -u` and `id -g` to find correct values

**Docker issues:**
- Try `docker-compose down -v` to clean up, then rebuild
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- For development: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v`

**Frontend won't load:**
- Wait 30 seconds after "webpack compiled" message
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

**Images not updating:**
- Pull latest images: `docker-compose pull`
- For development, rebuild: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
