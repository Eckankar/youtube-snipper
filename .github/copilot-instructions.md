# Copilot / LLM instructions for this repository

Please follow these guidelines when generating code or edits for this project:

- Do not insert AI-style markers in code (for example: "NEW:", "UPDATED:", "ADDED:", etc.).
- Keep inline comments concise and developer-oriented. If you need to explain a change, use normal comments as a developer would â€” not prefixed with "NEW" or similar.
- Use commit messages or PR descriptions to describe what changed and why; do not annotate the code with change markers intended for human review.
- When providing file diffs or suggestions, avoid repeating large unchanged sections of code; show minimal context and the actual changes.
- Follow the existing code style and comment conventions in the repository.

Thank you.
